# Portfolio

**Hi!** You probably came here from the live version of this code, or you stumbled across it on my GitHub.

This repository contains the code for my portfolio site. Feel free to have a look! If you see any issues or room for improvement, don't hesistate to create an issue!

Because of some future plans with this I have also set up a backend for this at [https://github.com/JonathanBout/Portfolio.Backend](https://github.com/JonathanBout/Portfolio.Backend). Currently, it mostly serves as a gateway to the GitHub GraphQL API, the Gravatar API and the [skillicons.dev](https://skillicons.dev) API, to be able to be able to customize caching and get some nice statistics.
